            <p>Odysseus and his men were trapped in the cave of Cyclops Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon's cave, who first showed hospitality but soon turns hostile.
            He devours two of Odysseus's men on the spot and imprisons Odysseus and the rest of Odysseus's crew in his cave for future meals. The considerate
            Odysseus notices that only Polyphemus is strong enough to move the rock that he placed across the door of his cave. Thus, Odysseus devises and 
            executes a plan. He gets Polyphemus drunk on wine that he brought along from the ship and as soon as Polyphemus collapses with intoxication, Odysseus
            stabs Polyphemus with a burning sword. Under the astonishing leadership Odysseus executes, everyone was able to escape safely.<p>
